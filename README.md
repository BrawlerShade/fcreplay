# FCREPLAY
This is sort of a mad scientist project to record and upload [fightcade](https://www.fightcade.com/) replays to
archive.org: [Gino Lisignoli - Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Gino+Lisignoli%22)

## How it works
Using some python (and a janky bash) scripts I scrape the fightcade replay urls from the site. Store them in a sqlite3
database with the relevant information.

A random replay is then selected and the capture script is started. Fightcade is started with wine, and then OBS is
started to record the match. After the match is finished (based on the length of the match), OBS is killed the python
script takes over again.

The script then takes over and:
 1. Renames the file to the fightcade id
 1. Runs ffmpeg to correct it since killing OBS might break the file
 1. Runs ffmpeg again to generate a thumbnail
 1. Tries to determine which characters players are using
 1. Uploads the file to archive.org with the relevant metadata
 1. Removes the generated files.

## Character Detection
OpenCV is used to analise the video and match character names from the health bars. It does this by template matching
the included character name images against the video every 60 frames. Depending on your OBS recording settings you might
need to regenerate the images.

### A few more notes:
To trigger OBS I am capturing the screen, looking for a the split windows, then checking for differences in the screen
capture. This might seem crude, but without memory inspection it doesn't seem like there is a way to tell when
the emulator has started playing the replay.

Because fightcade doesn't have the ability to record to a video file you need to use some sort of capture software.

For this project I use [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/). While it doesn't have a lot of scripting
ability out of the box, it seemed to work fairly well. I did initially try to just use ffmpeg and capture x11 with
audio, but for some reason it would always drop to 20fps or less.

I use the i3 window manager to ensure that the ggpofba-ng window is always in the same place, and have preconfigured
OBS to record that area.

This is all done in a headless X11 session

## Todo
 - Remove a bunch of jank. There is a lot of late night coding just to make things work.
 - Better exception handling.
 - Support for games other than 3rd strike.
 - Better installation.
 - Find something that might be more lightweight than OBS.
 - Possibly find a way to do multiple recordings at once.
 - Fix archive.org thumbnails

## Goal
The goal of this was to make fightcade replays accessible to anyone to watch without the need of using an emulator.

## Requirements
To run this yourself you need:
 1. A VM or physical machine.
     1. With at least 4 Cores (Fast ones would be ideal)
     1. With at least 2GB Ram
     1. With at least 20GB of storage (Though you probably won't use that much)
 1. Running Debian (you can probably make this work in other distributions as well)
     1. You really want to use a minimal installation
 1. Some familiarity with linux will help

## Configuration
The defaults should work if you follow the guide below.

### Uploading to archive.org
To upload files to archive.org, set the configuration key `upload_to_ia` to `true` and configure the ia section in the
configuration file. You will also need to have your `.ia` secrets file in your users home directory. This can be
generated by running `ia configure` from the command line once you have setup the python virtual environment.

## Installation
I'll probably create an Ansible script, but the manual steps are:

Install the packages:
```
apt-get install \
        i3 \
        xinit \
        vim \
        obs-studio \
        x11vnc \
        firewalld \
        pulseaudio \
        xserver-xorg-video-dummy \
        tmux \
        git \
        unzip \
        xterm \
        rsync \
        portaudio19-dev \
        python-dev \
        alsa-utils \
        gcc \
        python3-dev \
        python3-venv \
        sqlite3 \
        ffmpeg \
        pavucontrol \
        jq
```

Install wine:
```commandline
dpkg --add-architecture i386
apt-get update
apt install \
    wine \
    wine32 \
    wine64 \
    libwine \
    libwine:i386 \
    fonts-wine
```

Enable firewalld:
```commandline
systemctl enable firewalld
systemctl start firewalld
```

Add a firewalld rule to allow x11vnc:
```commandline
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=5900/tcp
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5900/tcp
```

Add the fbarecorder user:
```commandline
useradd -m -s /usr/bin/bash fbarecorder
```

Add user to the pulse, pulse-access and input groups:
```commandline
usermod -a -G pulse,pulse-access,input fbarecorder
```

Switch to the fbarecorder user and install the package in a virtual env:
```commandline
su fbarecorder -
git clone https://github.com/glisignoli/fcreplay.git ~/fcreplay_install
cd ~/fcreplay_install
python3 -m venv ./venv
python3 setup install
```

Edit the config file and replace the defaults `fcreplay.config`

Create a x11vnc password as the fbarecorder user (It will be stored in ~/.vnc/passwd):
```commandline
x11vnc -storepasswd 
```

Download pyqtggpo-0.42 and unzip it as the fbarecorder user:
```commandline
mkdir ~/fcreplay
cd ~/fcreplay
wget https://github.com/poliva/pyqtggpo/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
```

Copy the xorg.conf and Xwrapper.conf file to /etc/X11 as the root user
These files are installed in the python package installation directory

Now you need to start the dummy X server, configure fightcade and configure OBS.
As the fbarecorder user:
```commandline
# Run tmux, and split so you have two panes
# In the first pane, run startx
startx
# In the second pane, run x11vnc
x11vnc --rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd -noxfixes -noxdamage -noxrecord
```

Using a vnc client, connect to your server. Once you have authenticated you will be prompted to generate the default i3
config. Hit win+return to spawn a terminal. 

Add the following line to the fbarecorder users i3 config:
```
# Add the following to ~/.config/i3/config
exec --no-startup-id "/usr/bin/xterm"
```

Start the pulseaudio server
```commandline
pulseaudio --start
```

Check that it's working by run pavucontrol
```commandline
pavuconrol
```

In the i3 session, run ggpofba-ng:
```commandline
cd ~/fcreplay/pyqtggpo-master
wine ggpofba-ng.exe
```

And configure it with:
 1. Select blitter: Enhanced.
 1. Blitter options, mark these:
     1. Enable Pre-scale
     1. Pre-scale using SoftFX
     1. RGB effects
     1. Advanced settings: Force 16-bit emulation & Use DirectX texture management
 1. Stretch: Correct aspect ratio

Close ggpofba, and run OBS:
```commandline
obs
```

Configure OBS for your systems performance. You want to change the video output directory to `~/fcreplay/videos` with
a static filename (set in the advanced section) as `replay`. Make sure to disable recording of the mouse cursor as well

Now you need to configure the scene. I found the best way to do this was to have ggpofba running, then switch OBS to a
i3 floating window (win+shift+space).

 * I'm using a canvas resolution of 512x384 and a output resolutuon of 512.384.
 * For the screen capture I'm using the following crop/pad filter settings:
   * Left: 514
   * Top: 204
   * Right: 2
   * Bottom: 184


After doing all this you can start recording. Activate the python environment with:
```commandline
cd ~/fcreplay
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Now grab some replays:
```commandline
fcreplayget <fightcade profile>
```

This will download quite a few replays, and place them in a sqlite3 database (replays.db).
Now you can trigger the recording loop, Run:
```commandline
fcreplayloop
````

Once a loop has started you can close the vnc session and
leave it running.

You can also run `fcreplayloop --debug` to only run for a single iteration. Useful for testing.
